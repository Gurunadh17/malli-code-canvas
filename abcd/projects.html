    <h2>1. Static Website Hosting on AWS S3</h2>
    <p>I hosted a fully functional static website on <b>AWS S3</b> using a custom HTML, CSS, and images.  
    I configured public access, uploaded files, and tested the website URL.  
    This project helped me understand <b>cloud storage, hosting, and permissions</b> in AWS.</p>

    <h2>2. Serverless Image Upload Application</h2>
    <p>Built a <b>serverless application</b> where users can upload images to S3, and it triggers a <b>AWS Lambda</b> function.  
    The Lambda processes the image and sends a notification via <b>AWS SNS</b>.  
    This project gave me hands-on experience with <b>event-driven architecture, serverless computing, and cloud automation</b>.</p>

    <h2>3. IAM User & Role Management Project</h2>
    <p>Practiced creating <b>IAM users, roles, and policies</b> in AWS.  
    I simulated real-world scenarios: granting least-privilege access, creating groups, and managing permissions for different projects.  
    This improved my understanding of <b>cloud security, authentication, and authorization</b>.</p>

    <h2>4. Python Automation Scripts for AWS</h2>
    <p>Developed Python scripts to automate common AWS tasks such as <b>creating S3 buckets, uploading objects, and managing resources</b>.  
    Learned to integrate <b>Boto3 library</b> with Python and make cloud operations efficient and reproducible.</p>

    <h2>5. Cloud Project: Portfolio Website</h2>
    <p>Created my personal portfolio website hosted entirely on AWS, linking multiple pages like Home, Early Life, Education, Career, Projects, and Timeline.  
    This project gave me practical experience in <b>website hosting, structuring projects, cloud deployment, and user experience design</b>.</p>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>Through these projects, I strengthened my skills in <b>AWS cloud services, Python programming, serverless computing, and web development</b>.  
    Each project represents a real-world scenario and helped me become more confident in solving problems using cloud technologies.</p>
