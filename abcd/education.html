    <h2>Schooling</h2>
    <p>I completed my schooling at [Bala Bharathi EM high school], where I developed strong foundations in science, mathematics, and logical thinking.  
    I was always curious about computers and technology, and I often explored ways to solve problems creatively during school projects and assignments.</p>

    <h2>College / Degree</h2>
    <p>I pursued a <b>B.Tech in [Information Technology]</b> at [NBKR Institute of science and Technology]. College was a turning point in my life — here I not only learned technical skills but also developed critical thinking, teamwork, and project management abilities.  
    I participated in workshops, coding challenges, and cloud-related seminars which fueled my interest in AWS and cloud computing.</p>

    <h2>Learning AWS & Cloud</h2>
    <p>During my studies, I realized the power of cloud computing in transforming businesses and technology.  
    I started hands-on labs with AWS services like IAM, S3, EC2, Lambda, and SNS. These experiences taught me how to build practical solutions and made me more confident in my technical skills.</p>

    <h2>Extra-Curricular Learning</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Participated in coding competitions and hackathons.</li>
        <li>Completed online courses on AWS, Python, and Linux.</li>
        <li>Collaborated on small team projects and cloud experiments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Life Lessons from Education</h2>
